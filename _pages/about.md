I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at University of California, Irvine (UCI) advised by [Prof. Zhou Li](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/zhouli/). My research interests focus on privacy-preserving systems, secure machine learning, and applied cryptography. If you are interested into my research, welcome to contact me.

Prior to UCI, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2024 from Cryptography Lab in the Department of Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) supervised by [Prof. Sherman S.M. Chow](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~smchow/index.htm), and became an Interim Researcher co-advised by [Prof. Kai Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J2QAuAUAAAAJ&hl=en) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and [Prof. Kehuan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WJMoKskAAAAJ&hl=en) at CUHK . I obtained my Bachelor's degree (ranking: 1/96) in 2018 in the Department of Communication Engineering at Northeastern University, China advised by [Prof. Chong Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xq76xEMAAAAJ&hl=en).
